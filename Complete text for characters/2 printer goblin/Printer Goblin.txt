[Location: Copy Area]

You step into the dim hallway, the hum of flickering fluorescent lights echoing in the stillness. The air feels heavy, thick with an unsettling silence. Then, a faint noise shatters the quiet. A soft scratching. A rhythmic clicking. Something is near.

You turn the corner and—

A creature emerges from the shadows, its fingers stained with toner, twitching erratically. Its eyes gleam with a cold, mechanical light. A screech cuts through the air, sharp and jarring.

Enemy: PRINTER GOBLIN
"NO PRINT FOR YOU!"

You raise an eyebrow, unfazed.

You: "I don’t even want a print."

The Printer Goblin sneers, its jagged mouth creaking open like a malfunctioning printer.

Enemy: "Of course YOU don’t."

With a hiss, it lunges at you, flinging broken paper trays and shredded documents like makeshift weapons. Its movements are erratic, like a malfunctioning machine desperate for a fix.

Dialogue if you win:
The Printer Goblin stumbles back, sparks flying from its torn wires. It snarls in frustration, its limbs twitching spasmodically.

Printer Goblin: "Curse you! No one beats me... not... not even in the printer room..."

It crumples into a pile of malfunctioning gears and scraps, its glowing eyes dimming to nothingness. You step over the mess, unscathed.

You: "Next time, don’t mess with someone who’s on a paperless mission."
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you lose:
The Printer Goblin grins wickedly, its jagged mouth stretching wider as it flings more paper shrapnel in your direction. The last thing you hear before everything goes dark is the screeching sound of an error message.

Printer Goblin: "No print for you... ever again."

Your vision fades, the only thing left in your mind the cold mechanical laughter of your foe.
