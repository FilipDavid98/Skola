[Location: Break Room Corridor]

You step into the narrow corridor, the faint aroma of stale coffee lingering in the air. As you move forward, a figure emerges from the dim light. A woman stands before you, her eyes wide with fervor, and six coffee cups taped to her belt like some kind of strange holy relics. Each one is filled with a different shade of coffee, from the darkest black to a faint, over-extracted brew.

Enemy: COFFEE CULTIST
"Praise be the Brew!"

Her hands shake with devotion as she raises one of the cups high, the dark liquid sloshing dangerously.

You: "Uh, is that... safe?"

The Coffee Cultist glares, her voice almost a chant.

Enemy: "Safe? Safe is for the weak! The Brew is power! The Brew is LIFE!"

She steps forward, her eyes locking onto you as if you’re an enemy to her sacred ritual. Without warning, she throws one of the cups toward you—the coffee inside splashes in every direction, burning the floor like acid. Her other cups start to twitch as though they’re ready to follow suit.

Enemy: "You dare deny the Brew? FACE THE CONSEQUENCES!"

[Battle Begins...]
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you win:
The Coffee Cultist collapses, her cups scattering across the floor, coffee spilling everywhere. She looks up at you, eyes wide with disbelief as she tries to crawl toward the last remaining cup.

Coffee Cultist: "I... I was wrong... No more caffeine... only water..."

She fades into unconsciousness, muttering about her faith in the Brew fading away. The corridor is once again quiet, the air smelling a little less like coffee and a little more like victory.

You: "Next time, try decaf."
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you lose:
The Coffee Cultist grins maniacally as she hurls another cup, drenching you in a scorching stream of coffee. You stagger back, your vision blurry from the hot, bitter brew. The cups keep coming, one after another, until everything is a swirling mess of caffeine-induced chaos.

Coffee Cultist: "The Brew has claimed another soul! Praise be the Brew, for you will never escape its grip!"

The world around you fades to the sounds of a final, over-caffeinated chant, and your consciousness slips away into a caffeine-fueled stupor.
