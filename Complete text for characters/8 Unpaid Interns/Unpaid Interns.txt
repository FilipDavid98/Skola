[Location: Hall of Interns]

You walk through a narrow hallway lined with cubicles, the hum of printers and the clicking of keyboards filling the air. Suddenly, two figures emerge from the shadows—young, wide-eyed, and wearing badges that read “EXPOSABLE.” They sprint toward you with a strange determination, armed only with notepads and pens.

Enemies: UNPAID INTERN x2
"Work experience is its own reward!"

The first intern lunges at you, scribbling furiously on a notepad as if trying to capture every moment of this chaotic encounter.

Unpaid Intern 1:
"I just need one more entry on my résumé!"
The second intern is holding a stack of unfiled paperwork as a makeshift shield.
Unpaid Intern 2:
"I’m just so grateful to be here!"

You glance over at Pebbles, who’s watching the interns run toward you with an expression of complete disdain.

You:
"These guys? They’re not even paid for this..."
PEBBLES (grinning):
"I’ve been unpaid for years—this is personal."
(He cracks his knuckles, ready to throw down.)

[Battle Begins...]
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you win:
The interns collapse in exhaustion, their notepads and paperwork scattered across the floor. They look up at you with defeated eyes, realizing they’ve been crushed by the harsh realities of the workplace.

Unpaid Intern 1:
"I... I just wanted to network."
Unpaid Intern 2:
"Do we get... college credit for this?"

You and Pebbles share a look of silent understanding.
PEBBLES (laughing):
"Looks like they’ll need to clock out... for good."
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you lose:
The interns swarm you with their endless enthusiasm, each one attacking with a flurry of unfiled paperwork and an overload of corporate jargon. You’re overwhelmed by their unrelenting desire to “gain experience,” drowning in an avalanche of spreadsheets and photocopies.

Unpaid Intern 1:
"I’m doing this for my future! This will look so good on my LinkedIn!"
Unpaid Intern 2:
"I’ve already got an internship with the next company! You can’t stop me!"

As the paperwork smothers you, you slip into unconsciousness, wishing you’d taken a paid gig instead.
