CORPORATE LADDER TO HEAVEN
You are BOB. Just... Bob.
An average employee in a soul-crushing mega-corp that stretches across Earth.

One day, after being passed over for promotion by a guy who can’t even spell “Excel,” something in you snaps.

You will rise — not up the corporate ladder, but through it.
Coworkers, HR demons, soulless executives...
And if needed, you’ll kill the CEO of Earth himself.
Heaven help you. Because he won't.

[Location: Break Room – Smells like burnt coffee and lost dreams.]

You jolt awake in the corner of the break room.
Your badge is gone. Your dignity is questionable.
Across from you stands an old janitor with glowing eyes.

JANITOR:
"The system is broken, kid... but you can break it first."

[You receive a thermos of Healing Coffee (+HP).]
