[Location: HR Hellroom]

You step into the heart of HR. The room is lit by the eerie glow of a circle of flaming contracts, each one smoldering with the weight of endless paperwork. A demon in business casual stands at the center, adjusting her blazer as she holds a clipboard, her eyes glowing with an unsettling fluorescent light.

Mini-Boss: HR DEMONESS LINDA ( Pyrocoil )
"Time for your annual evaluation... IN HELL."

HR Demoness Linda: "Let’s see... last year’s feedback? Needs improvement... interpersonal issues... and you still haven't met your KPI goals. Not to mention, your fire drill participation... disappointing."

She taps her clipboard, and the flaming contracts swirl around her, turning into fiery projectiles. With a snap of her fingers, they launch toward you, each one a scalding reminder of the bureaucratic nightmare she’s created.

HR Demoness Linda: "Oh, don’t worry... we’ll go over your 360 review in excruciating detail."

Dialogue if you win:
The final contract crumbles to ash as Linda falters, her clipboard shattering into a pile of smoldering fragments. She staggers back, her demonic form flickering like a glitch in the system.

HR Demoness Linda: "You... you can’t... quit... if you’re already... fired..."

Her body dissolves into a puff of smoke, leaving behind an HR Badge at the center of the room. The flames surrounding the contracts die down, the air thick with the scent of burnt paper.

"Unlocks access to all employee perks... if you’re brave enough to endure more evaluations."

You: "Finally, some time off. I earned this."
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you lose:
Linda watches with a cold smile as you’re overwhelmed by the barrage of flaming contracts, each one burning with corporate wrath. You try to dodge, but her relentless stream of feedback wears you down. The contracts hit their mark, each one a searing reminder of your failures.

HR Demoness Linda: "Oh, you poor thing. This is what happens when you miss your quarterly reviews. Don’t worry, though—you can always try again next year... after you fill out the exit survey."

As your vision fades and the sound of corporate jargon fills your mind, you lose all sense of time, trapped in the never-ending loop of HR hell.
