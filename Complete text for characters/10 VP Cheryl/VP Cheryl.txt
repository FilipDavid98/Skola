[Location: Executive Sky Lounge]

You step into the sky-high lounge, its panoramic windows offering a breathtaking view of the city below. The room is pristine, filled with sleek, modern furniture and glowing KPI charts floating in mid-air. At the center of it all, suspended on a hover-desk, is VP Cheryl—a figure of corporate authority, draped in the latest business casual attire. Her eyes narrow at you as she swivels her desk toward you, a tablet in hand.

Mini-Boss: VICE PRESIDENT CHERYL
"I’m not mad. I’m just very disappointed."
He gestures to the floating charts around her, each one tracking "performance," "efficiency," and an overwhelming number of meaningless metrics. Her hover-desk hovers eerily above the ground, moving with mechanical precision.

VP Cheryl:
"You’ve missed your KPIs for the quarter... again. I’m not angry. Just disappointed."
The room’s atmosphere shifts, the glowing charts now growing more intense, as if responding to her displeasure. A soft hum fills the air, and the ambient tension is palpable.

You:
"Is this what happens when you don't meet ‘synergy’ goals?"
PEBBLES (grinning):
"She’s gonna need a little more than a PowerPoint to handle us. I’m unimpressed."

VP Cheryl (smiling coldly):
"Let’s see if you can handle the heat of performance reviews, then."

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you win:
Cheryl’s hover-desk sputters and jolts to a halt as her glowing KPIs flicker and collapse. She drops to the floor, winded, as her once-imposing presence crumbles. The floating charts disintegrate around her, leaving nothing but empty data.

VP Cheryl (wheezing):
"Tell... Karen... her... perfume... is... awful..."
She stumbles to her feet, her aura of authority shattered.

You (smirking):
"Don’t worry, Cheryl. I’ll make sure Karen knows."

The Motivational Shield around her flickers one last time before breaking apart, revealing the path forward.

PEBBLES (grinning):
"Another executive down... finally. Who’s next, Bob?"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Dialogue if you lose:
Cheryl’s KPIs ramp up to full power, flooding the room with overwhelming data streams. You and Pebbles struggle to keep up as her hover-desk moves in precise, calculated patterns, blocking every attempt to break through. She watches with disdain as you falter under the weight of impossible expectations.

VP Cheryl:
"I knew you couldn't handle the pressure. Disappointing... truly."
You drop to your knees, exhausted and defeated by the unrelenting waves of corporate disappointment. The KPIs continue to hover in the air, blinking with judgment.

VP Cheryl:
"Maybe next quarter, you’ll be able to catch up."
