
CORPORATE LADDER TO HEAVEN
You are BOB. Just... Bob.
An average employee in a soul-crushing mega-corp that stretches across Earth.

One day, after being passed over for promotion by a guy who can’t even spell “Excel,” something in you snaps.

You will rise — not up the corporate ladder, but through it.
Coworkers, HR demons, soulless executives...
And if needed, you’ll kill the CEO of Earth himself.
Heaven help you. Because he won't.
